Description:
	Provides methods to analyze micro-randomized trials (MRTs) with binary treatment options.  Supports three types of analyses: (1) proximal causal excursion effects, including weighted and centered least squares (WCLS) for continuous proximal outcomes by Boruvka et al. (2018) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1305274> and the estimator for marginal excursion effect (EMEE) for binary proximal outcomes by Qian et al. (2021) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa070>; (2) distal causal excursion effects (DCEE) for continuous distal outcomes using a two-stage estimator by Qian (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2502.13500>; and (3) mediated causal excursion effects (MCEE) for continuous distal outcomes, estimating natural direct and indirect excursion effects in the presence of time-varying mediators by Qian (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2506.20027>.
